Respected Prof. {{ name }},

My name is Ayush Pandey, a Junior Undergraduate engineering student pursuing a minor degree specialization in Design at the Indian Insitute of Technology(IIT), Delhi [http://www.iitd.ac.in]. I am writing this mail to apply for a Research Project in HCI at {{ university }} under your guidance from May 2021 - July 2021.


I have a keen interest in Design Innovation, Psychology and User Research, research that creates empathetic designs for the targeted user group. Through my courses and past internships, I have developed a strong inclination towards the field of Interaction Design.

My undergraduate research project at UX Lab, IIT Delhi, under Professor Jyoti Kumar, is concerned with the development of non-intrusive or non-invasive physiological measures for the measurement of cognitive load in HCI systems. I have also worked as a UX Design Intern at Autogenerate.AI, where my primary work involved improving the usability of various functionalities of their online platform.


My project at the Dept. of Design, IIT Delhi, was the design of fitness app. Furthermore, I have participated in many design challenges and have designed apps for online classrooms and profile connectivity. 


Your work in the field of {{field}} seems very interesting to me, and it has inspired me to learn more about HCI and its applications. I'm writing to you to ask you if whether you currently have any research projects in Interaction Design or HCI, which I could work on, as I find the field fascinating. If presented with an opportunity, I can assure you that I would put in my best efforts and prove to be a positive contributor to the research.
